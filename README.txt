RSAP: an adaptive Metropolis algorithm with rejection-based Gaussian proposal-scaling for fast convergence in multimodal parameter spaces

--------------------------------------------------------------

Contained in this repository is a Python script that is an implementation of the adaptive MCMC method called RSAP. We have written a paper describing in detail the theory and reasoning behind the method. We have submitted it to SIAM's Journal on Uncertainty Quantification (JUQ).

Paper status: ----------
